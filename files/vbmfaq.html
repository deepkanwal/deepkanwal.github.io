	<p> <b> How do I add the same game on multiple platforms? </b> </p>
	<p> Once you have added a multi-platform game to a platform, it can be added to another platfrom via the Add Games section of the app. Search for the game again, select 'Add' and then select the second platform. You can add the same game to all avaliable platforms. You cannot add the same game on the same platform twice. </p>

	<p> <b> What is the difference between the Backlog and the Full Backlog? </b> </p>
	<p> The Backlog includes games that you have not beaten and are not playing. The Full Backlog includes games that you have not attained 100% completion in and are not playing (regardless of wheather the game is beaten). </p>

<p> <b> I'm trying to add a game but some of the data is missing (ie. platforms).  </b> </p>
<p>
The app currently uses the GiantBomb Wiki (http://www.giantbomb.com/games/) for game data. A few games in the Wiki are missing data. Should you encounter such a game, feel free to let me know and I’ll update the Wiki. Alternatively, if you don’t feel like waiting for me to fix it, you can also update the Wiki yourself by creating a GiantBomb account, finding the game with the missing data, and making the associated edits.

<p> <b> I'm trying to add a game but the app says the game has been already been added on all available platforms. </b> </p>
<p>
This is the same issue as the above question and occurs when the GiantBomb Wiki is missing platform data for a game.

	<p> <b> How do I edit a game I added? </b> </p>
	<p> Once you have added a game, you can edit the game by accessing it via the Library, Now Playing or Backlog sections of the game.  This is slightly different behaviour than versions of the app prior to v1.2 where a game could be edited regardless of which section of the app you were in. This change comes as a result of adding the ability to add the same game on multiple platforms in v1.2. With v1.2 a game can only be added via the Add Games section, and only edited/deleted via the Now Playing / Backlog / Library sections of the app. </p>
